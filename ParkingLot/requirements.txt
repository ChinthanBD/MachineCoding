Here are the requirements for designing a parking lot:

1. **Parking Lot Layout**:
    - Define the number of levels (floors) in the parking lot.
    - Define the number of parking spots per level.
    - Define the types of parking spots (e.g., regular, compact, handicapped).

2. **Parking Spot Management**:
    - Each parking spot should have a unique identifier.
    - Track the availability of each parking spot.
        Finding the first available slot should be based on:
            The slot should be of the same type as the vehicle.
            The slot should be on the lowest possible floor in the parking lot.
            The slot should have the lowest possible slot number on the floor.
    - Ability to reserve and release a parking spot.

3. **Vehicle Management**:
    - Track the entry and exit of vehicles.
    - Each vehicle should have a unique identifier (e.g., license plate number).
    - Support different types of vehicles (e.g., car, motorcycle, truck).

4. **Payment System**:
    - Calculate parking fees based on the duration of the stay.
    - Support multiple payment methods (e.g., cash, credit card, mobile payment).
    - Issue receipts for payments.

5. **Security and Monitoring**:
    - Implement surveillance cameras for security.
    - Track the entry and exit times of vehicles for security purposes.

6. **User Interface**:
    - Provide a user interface for parking lot attendants to manage the parking lot.
    - Provide a user interface for customers to find available parking spots and make payments.

7. **Additional Features**:
    - Implement a notification system to alert users when their parking time is about to expire.
    - Provide electric vehicle charging stations.
    - Implement a loyalty program for frequent users.
    - Ensure that handicapped spots are only reserved for vehicles with the appropriate permits.
